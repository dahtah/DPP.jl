# DPP.jl: Determinantal Point Processes in Julia

Determinantal Point Processes are point processes with repulsion properties: define an appropriate function for representing similarity between items, and a DPP will sample a subset of "representative" items, i.e. ones that does not contain two items that are too similar.

## State of the package

The package works, is presumably useful, but is under-documented. See docs/build/ directory for some basic features.
